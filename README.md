# javaServer
JAVA Server for a group file sharing among the clients.

Features
--------
- Put files in a special directory that the clients can access.
- Can recieve files from the clients as well which are also placed in another special directory.
- Manage Users through the CLI
 
Note:
It's clients require it's IP address to be ble to connect to the server.

Bugs:
Proper removal of the users through the CLI is bugged out, but the users and their passwords can be managed by directly changing the CSV file holding the details.
